ft_printf is a project that aims to implement a simplified version of the standard printf function, which is commonly used in C for formatted output.
The goal of this project is to develop a deep understanding of how formatted output works and how to manipulate variadic arguments, working with different data types, and implementing format specifiers.
The ft_printf function is a reimplementation of the standard printf, which handles various format specifiers and outputs formatted data. It supports a wide range of data types such as integers, strings, characters
and pointers, and it formats the output based on the specifiers provided in the format string.
